This assignment was pretty straight forward. The only challenges for this assignment was that some of the documentation was outdated,
so you had to go to the docs in the github repo to find some of the flags that were necessary to run fairseq-train. I wrote scripts to 
process the data into the `data\processed` directory. I wrote bash scripts to run those and smaller bash scripts to run the fair-seq command line 
methods. Finally I wrote a py script that calculates and writes the WER score to a log in logging.  

I'm not sure if the formatting for those files is good,or whether it's appropriate to run bash scripts that run other bash scripts. 
I'm also not terribly happy with the organization of my repo, and in the future I would like to be able to produce industry standard organized repos. 
Specifically, I wasn't sure how to output files from thefairseq methods to a specific directory. I found that when running the `run` bash script, 
all files from other bash scripts were output to the same directory as the `run` script, but when running other bash scripts individually 
the output was written to the directory those bash scripts were in. So, I really need to work on cleaning up my code formatting and directory formatting. 
I'm also not sure for the writing so much code inside the name guard in `get_wer.py` is an appropriate thing to do. I also wanted to get to the stretch goals and work on finding a way 
to implement a full package that would allow a user to choose whether they want to train a LSTM or transformer, but I didn't have time. 
So overall, I didn't find the implementation difficult, but I'd very much like to increase my knowledge of industry standard coding principles
and to clean up my code and repo production.
